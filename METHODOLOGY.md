## 1. Data Preprocessing

### 1.1 Intensity Normalization

**Purpose:** Standardize intensity values across subjects to reduce scanner variability and improve comparability.

**Methods Implemented:**

1. **Z-score Normalization (Recommended)**
   - Formula: `z = (x - μ) / σ`
   - Centers data at zero with unit variance
   - Preserves relationships between intensities
   - Best for: Statistical analysis, group comparisons

2. **Min-Max Normalization**
   - Formula: `x_norm = (x - min) / (max - min)`
   - Scales to [0, 1] range
   - Sensitive to outliers
   - Best for: Visualization, certain ML algorithms

3. **Percentile-based Normalization**
   - Uses 1st and 99th percentiles
   - Robust to outliers
   - Clips extreme values
   - Best for: Noisy data, artifact-heavy scans

**Scientific Rationale:**
- MRI intensities are arbitrary and scanner-dependent
- Normalization enables cross-subject comparison
- Essential for multi-site studies

### 1.2 Background Removal

**Purpose:** Remove non-brain voxels (air, background noise) to focus analysis on brain tissue.

**Method:**
- Threshold-based segmentation
- Default threshold: 10% of maximum intensity
- Adaptive to different scan characteristics

**Benefits:**
- Reduces computational load
- Improves feature extraction accuracy
- Eliminates confounding background variation

### 1.3 Skull Stripping

**Purpose:** Extract brain tissue from the skull and surrounding structures.

**Implementation:**
- Simulated approach for synthetic data
- Morphological operations (erosion/dilation)
- In practice, use: FSL BET, FreeSurfer, or ANTs

**Scientific Basis:**
- Brain tissue has different characteristics than skull
- Skull removal improves brain-specific analysis
- Standard preprocessing step in neuroimaging

## 2. Feature Extraction

### 2.1 Volume Features

**Extracted Features:**
- Total Volume: Number of voxels in scan
- Brain Volume: Non-zero voxels after preprocessing
- Brain Fraction: Ratio of brain to total volume

**Clinical Relevance:**
- Brain atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases
- Tissue loss in stroke or trauma
- Development studies

**Formula:**
```
Brain Fraction = Brain Volume / Total Volume
```

### 2.2 Intensity Features

**Statistical Measures:**
- **Central Tendency:** Mean, median
- **Dispersion:** Standard deviation, range, IQR
- **Shape:** Skewness, kurtosis

**Neurobiological Interpretation:**
- **Mean Intensity:** Overall tissue characteristics
- **Std Deviation:** Tissue heterogeneity
- **Skewness:** Asymmetry in intensity distribution
- **Kurtosis:** Presence of extreme values (lesions, artifacts)

**Why These Matter:**
- Different tissues have different intensities
- Pathology alters normal intensity patterns
- Quantifies subtle changes

### 2.3 Texture Features

**Based on:** First-order statistics and histogram analysis

**Features:**
- **Entropy:** Randomness/disorder in intensities
  - Formula: `H = -Σ(p(i) * log2(p(i)))`
  - Higher entropy = more heterogeneous tissue

- **Energy:** Uniformity of intensity distribution
  - Formula: `E = Σ(p(i)²)`
  - Higher energy = more homogeneous tissue

- **Homogeneity:** Local similarity
  - Measures smoothness of intensity changes
  
- **Contrast:** Intensity variation
  - Ratio of std to mean
  - Indicates tissue heterogeneity

**Clinical Applications:**
- Tumor characterization
- Tissue damage assessment
- White matter lesion analysis

### 2.4 Morphological Features

**Shape Analysis:**

1. **Surface Area**
   - Estimated from boundary voxels
   - Reflects brain surface complexity
   
2. **Compactness**
   - Formula: `C = Volume / Surface Area`
   - Measures shape regularity
   
3. **Sphericity**
   - Ratio of eigenvalues from moment analysis
   - Indicates how sphere-like the shape is
   
4. **Elongation**
   - Ratio of principal axes
   - Measures shape asymmetry

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Based on moment analysis
- Uses eigenvalue decomposition
- Quantifies 3D shape properties

**Clinical Significance:**
- Structural changes in disease
- Developmental abnormalities
- Focal vs. diffuse changes

### 2.5 Regional Features

**Approach:** Divide brain into spatial regions

**Implementation:**
- Axial slices (superior-inferior)
- Sagittal slices (left-right)
- 8 regions per axis

**Analysis:**
- Mean intensity per region
- Captures spatially localized differences

**Advantages:**
- Detects focal pathology
- Identifies regional patterns
- Complements global measures

**Scientific Basis:**
- Many diseases affect specific regions
- Regional analysis increases sensitivity
- Enables anatomical localization

## 3. Statistical Analysis

### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Purpose:** Summarize and describe each group

**Computed for Each Feature:**
- Mean, median, std
- Min, max, range
- Quartiles (Q1, Q3), IQR

**Importance:**
- Understand data distribution
- Identify outliers
- Check assumptions for tests

### 3.2 Independent t-tests

**When Used:** Comparing means between two groups

**Assumptions:**
- Independence of observations
- Approximate normal distribution
- Homogeneity of variance (relaxed with Welch's t-test)

**Output:**
- t-statistic
- p-value (significance)
- Degrees of freedom

**Interpretation:**
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant difference
- Direction from sign of t-statistic

**Formula:**
```
t = (μ₁ - μ₂) / √(s²/n₁ + s²/n₂)
```

### 3.3 Effect Size (Cohen's d)

**Purpose:** Quantify magnitude of difference (beyond statistical significance)

**Formula:**
```
d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled

where σ_pooled = √[((n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²) / (n₁+n₂-2)]
```

**Interpretation:**
- |d| < 0.2: Negligible
- |d| = 0.2-0.5: Small
- |d| = 0.5-0.8: Medium
- |d| > 0.8: Large

**Why Effect Size Matters:**
- Statistical significance depends on sample size
- Effect size indicates practical significance
- Essential for meta-analysis

### 3.4 Mann-Whitney U Test

**When Used:** Non-parametric alternative to t-test

**Advantages:**
- No normality assumption
- Robust to outliers
- Works with ordinal data

**Method:**
- Rank-based comparison
- Tests if distributions differ

**Use Cases:**
- Small sample sizes
- Non-normal distributions
- Presence of outliers

### 3.5 Multiple Comparison Correction

**Problem:** Testing many features increases false positive rate

**Solution:** Bonferroni correction
- Adjusted α = α / number_of_tests
- Conservative but simple

**Alternative Approaches (not implemented):**
- False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- Holm-Bonferroni
- Benjamini-Hochberg

**Scientific Rationale:**
- Controls family-wise error rate
- Reduces false discoveries
- Standard practice in neuroimaging

### 3.6 Classification Analysis

**Method:** Random Forest Classifier

**Why Random Forest:**
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance
- Robust to overfitting
- No strong distributional assumptions

**Validation:**
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Stratified splits
- Multiple metrics (accuracy, std)

**Feature Importance:**
- Mean decrease in impurity
- Identifies most discriminative features
- Complements univariate tests

**Interpretation:**
- Accuracy: Overall correct classification rate
- Baseline: 50% (random guessing for balanced data)
- > 70%: Good separation
- > 90%: Excellent separation
